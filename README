1 ... Project Description
=========================

System Synopsis
---------------
This AutoTools project contains the libmgesysutils MGE System Utilities Library.

Notable function subjects include:-
Config file parsing.
Send a remote syslog entry.

If you are going to build, or build against, this libmgesysutils MGE System
Utilities Library then you must install the development files.

Project Structure
-----------------
This AutoTools project contains the entire MGE System Utilities Library System.

Whilst this project can be treated as a single entity, (build, install,
uninstall, etc), it is designed so that only the desired elements, the library
itself or all the parts can be installed on a system. Indeed, by the time this
system is packaged downstream, it is split into 3 packages.

These individual elements are contained in 3 subdirectories of the project root
and they are all AutoTools sub-projects in their own right. These sub-projects
are:-

dev		The development files for the library libmgesysutils.
lib		The general library libmgesysutils.
doc		Doxygen documentation on the entire project.

The development files generally consist of c header files, pkg-config files and
man pages.

Any dependencies not installed on your system will be identified by the
configure script. Any of these produced by this author can be found in a
repository located here:-
https://github.com/m-grant-prg

Please also refer to the specific README files in dev/ doc/ and lib/.

N.B.
----
At a source modification / development level, this project expects to reside in
a git environment. This manifests itself in 3 places:-
1) ... .gitignore files are included in the source.
2) ... The make target, 'srctarball', relies on the command 'git am' so it will
	fail if git is not installed or it is not in a git repository.
3) ... Package building for the full project relies on the command
	'git describe' so it will fail if git is not installed or it is not in
	a git repository. (As said before, building the full package is not a
	particularly meaningful task.)


-------------------------------------------------
2 ... AutoTools (configure and make) Installation
=================================================

a) ... Download either the source or distribution tarball (the .tar.gz file)
	from:-
	https://github.com/m-grant-prg/libmgesysutils/releases

b) ... Extract the tarball preserving the directory structure.

c) ... cd to the directory created.

d) ... If you downloaded the source tarball type 'autoreconf -if'

e) ... Type './configure'

f) ... As root or sudo, type 'make install clean'

(Quote marks are for textual clarity only).

To uninstall the package:

1 ... cd to the directory created in the above install process.

2 ... As root or sudo, type 'make uninstall clean'


----------------------------------------------
3 ... Ubuntu, Debian and Raspbian Installation
==============================================
Please refer to the relevant installation section on the wiki at:-

https://github.com/m-grant-prg/libmgesysutils/wiki

4 ... Utility Scripts
=====================
In the project root directory there is a helper script; bootstrap.sh

bootstrap.sh
------------
This misleadingly named script bootstraps the project build and provides other
useful features. The main options below are probably b, c, C, D and T.

In AutoTools it is usually advisable to perform parallel builds. This means you
build somewhere other than the project root. This is because building creates
files and they would confuse the project root downwards. I always create a build
directory straight off the project root, cd to there and do all build and git
work from there, (.gitignore is already set to ignore such a directory).

Assuming you adopt the preceding paragraph then a typical invocation of the
script would be:-
../bootstrap.sh --build ..
The last '..' points the way to project root.

The full list of arguments to bootstrap.sh are:-
	-b, --build make the project.

	-c, --config configure the project.

	-C, --distcheck perform a normal make distcheck.

	-d, --debug build with appropriate debug flags.

	-D, --dist perform a make dist.

	-F, --distcheckfake run a make distcheck using a fake AT standard
	directory as a substitute for an absolute path which distcheck does not
	support.

	-g, --gnulib run gnulib-tool --update. Checks for the existence of the
	cache file proj-root/m4/gnulib-cache.m4. If it does not exist the update
	is not run.

	-h, --help prints usage information.

	-s, --sparse pass --enable-sparse=yes to configure.

	-T, --source-tarball perform a make srctarball to build a source
	tarball.

	-V, --version prints version information

Options b build, C distcheck, D dist, F distcheckfake and T source-tarball are
mutually exclusive.

Options d debug, F distcheckfake and s sparse are enabled by configure so
require option c config.
